Design Documents


The problem that I am solving is the lack of Mario Kart available in different forms than just Nintendo platforms. In doing so, I did my best to recreate the game play of Mario Kart and added the complexity of making my own controller. This controller simulates the Wii U tilt methods using buttons to active different parts of the game. 

To begin the design, I laid out what functions or features can be reachable in the constraints of python and time. Which included the following:
	One Map
	One User racing against one AI
	Time Trail
	Item Boxes have limited choices
	Limited Collision ability
	Limited UI and Image quality
See Competitive Analysis, Storyboard folder, and Term Project Proposal to read more about how I begin to lay out the function and what I took from other game types. I evolved to a lesser version than dreamt, but stayed true to the most part.
